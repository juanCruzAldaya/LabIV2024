                    <h3> Terraform</h3>
                    <article>
                        <details> Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). Here are some key reasons why itâ€™s highly regarded:
                            Platform-Agnostic: Terraform can manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, as well as on-premises environments1.
                            Declarative Syntax: You define your infrastructure in configuration files using a simple, human-readable syntax. This makes it easier to understand and manage2.
                            Version Control: Since configurations are written in code, you can version, reuse, and share them, ensuring consistency and reducing errors1. </details>

                        <details>
                            All-in-One Platform: GitLab provides a single application for the complete DevOps lifecycle, from planning and source code management to CI/CD, monitoring, and security1.
                            Seamless Integration: It eliminates the need for multiple tools and integrations, reducing complexity and potential points of failure1.
                            Automation: GitLab supports extensive automation, including automated testing, builds, and deployments, which helps in speeding up the development process and reducing manual errors2.
                            Security: Security is integrated into the DevOps lifecycle, with features like vulnerability scanning and compliance checks at every stage1.
